How to integrate SBEngine into your project
-------------------------------------------

Copy SConstruct and SConsProject files from templates directory into
root dir of your project. Modify SConsProject file for your needs.
Don't modify SConstruct file, it will automatically fetch SBEngine
from git repository.

Optionally you can integrate full SBEngine directly into your project
by copying project directory of SBEngine into builder directory in the
root directory of your project.
