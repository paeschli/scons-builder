1. Creation of Distribution Tarballs

In SConscript file(s) declare all files which should be in the tarball:

env.DistributeFiles(source, distPath=None, distGroup=None)

source    : single filename, list of files, or list of produced targets of a
            builder
            
distPath  : path where the file will reside in the distribution tarball

distGroup : name of a distribution group, might be used for creating
            of multiple tarballs with different content e.g. binary or source
            code distribution.
            
Example:

speed_test = env.Program('speed_test', 'speed_test.cpp', LIBS=['rtsgvrml']+LIBRTSG)
env.DistributeFiles(speed_test, distPath='bin', distGroup='bin')

Distribute all binaries for a program speed_test with path bin in the tarball.
Mark all binaries as belonging to the 'bin' group.

In SConsProject file declare all distribution tarballs with CreateDist
command:

env.CreateDist(targetFile, distGroups=None, distRootDir=None,
               distFormat="bz2", excludeExts=None, excludeDirs=None)
               
targetFile  : file name of the distribution tarball, use '#/' prefix in order to create
             a file in the project root directory

distGroups  : list of names of distribution groups to include into tarball.

distRootDir : name of the root dir contained in the tarball archive,
              distPath used in DistributeFiles command will be relative
              to this path

distFormat  : archive format to use, gz and bz2 are supported

excludeExts : exclude all files which extensions are in the specified list.

excludeDirs : exclude all directories which are in the specified list.

Example:

release = env.CreateDist('#/'+RELEASE_NAME,
                         Split('bin'),
                         'rtsg',
                         excludeExts=['.cvsignore', '.sconsign'],
                         excludeDirs=['CVS','.svn','.sconf_temp'])
env.Alias('release', release)

Declare distribution tarball and set 'release' target to build it.
Only files from the distribution group 'bin' will be included.
The filename prefix of the archive is 'rtsg'. Files with extensions
.cvsignore and .sconsign, as well as CVS, .svn, and .sconf_temp directories
will be ignored.
